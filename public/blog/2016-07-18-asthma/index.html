    <p>It was a cold day and I could feel my feet beginning to get cold. A little itch began to creep up my throat, bringing out a small cough - much better. Slowly, but surely this itch grew and my coughing grew harsher. I thought nothingof it as it was winter and a little coughing never killed anyone. Then it started to hit me, the tightness of my chest, the sudden inability to breathe. I was taking a shower and for whatever reason I thought it was the hot, humid air that was making it harder to breathe; I opened the window and sucked in big mouthfuls of the crisp winter air. It was only much later that I would learn that cold air would have exactly the opposite effect on my condition.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Coming out of the shower, I was gasping for breath. Each and every breath was an immensely tough task as I struggled to get enough oxygen into my lungs. My parents were concerned and doing a quick Google search yielded results: I probably had asthma. Later I would realize that this Korean word that I had all my childhood was actually Korean for asthma - I never thought much of it then, and why should I have? I had never experienced anything like this and the worst of it was just a bit of coughing. I went with my dad to the pharmacy close by but even getting there was an ordeal in itself. Each step was heavy and it felt as if I couldn&rsquo;t hold my own body up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget buying the medicine and taking a puff of the inhaler in the crips winter air. Suddenly, I felt a sensation of my airways opening up and I felt better. After that, I&rsquo;d find myself depending on this little piece of plastic and metal to save me from my inability to breathe properly. But things didn&rsquo;t work out perfectly, from that moment on I&rsquo;d experience the worst my asthma had to offer. I often found myself coughing and unable to breathe - even my medication didn&rsquo;t help for long. Sleeping was a nightmare, whenever I lay down my lungs would feel even heavier and breathing was absolutely out of the question. Many things triggered this: cold air, allergens, sickness. Eac time, I was miserable and I envied my friends who didn&rsquo;t have this condition.</p>
<p>In middle school, I&rsquo;d often find myself having to take a break while playing handball and use my inhaler. After that I&rsquo;d be pretty much good to go all day. Sure, it was a hindrance but I never gave it much thought except when I felt like dying in one of those episodes. Then I got to high school and forced to run as part of my gym class. The first few were okay surprisingly, but as winter came around I found myself struggling to keep up with my class mates. It was infuriating. It wasn&rsquo;t because of my unwillingness nor laziness - it was a physical inability to keep up to those who could breathe freely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be honest, it made me feel terrible. All I wanted in life was to not have this condition affecting me, to be able to physically exert myself with my stamina being the limit not my lungs. I&rsquo;m sure people understand the feeling of hopelessness as they see others exceeding what they are capable of doing. Despite that, I tried my best and for an asthmatic that seemed like he was going to die after every run, I&rsquo;d like to think I did okay. But I was never content as I felt that the limiting factor in 99% of the scenarios wasmy asthma. Joining track just exacerbated this issue as I found myself even further behind than usual - after all this was the group of people who put their all into running.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I kept pushing myself. Seeing these other people made me want to be like them. Asthma? Who cares. If they could do it, then I can as well. With this mentality I kept pushing myself in running. I&rsquo;ve missed out on running in gym once because of my asthma (it was especially bad that time), and I made up that run later on. During workout, even if I were far behind I&rsquo;d just try my best to finish. At that point it didn&rsquo;t matter that I was the last one, it just mattered that I finished what I had started. Running and asthma really changed how I think and added willpower to my personality. Yet, there&rsquo;s not a day that goes by in which I hope that one day I won&rsquo;t have to deal with this and I can be free. Until then, I won&rsquo;t use it as an excuse, people have done much more with a greater handicap. It&rsquo;s just how I am and I accept that.</p>

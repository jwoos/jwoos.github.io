    <p>After dealing with a very old and sluggish desktop for a long time, I finally had enough and decided to build my own computer. This decision was a long time in coming as I never really had a compelling reason to make it seeing as I had a very capable laptop. But, a computer isn&rsquo;t just a computer, as I&rsquo;ve learned. Desktops are not laptops. I wanted a home computer to game and work on without wanting to smash my screen. So I decided to take the leap. I&rsquo;ve previously helped some of my friends pick their parts and build their computers. It was finally my turn.</p>
<p>Looking for parts was both exhiliarating and depressing. On one hand, I saw before me such a diverse array of possible parts that I was overwhelmed. There were so many very good parts, and each had an aura about it. However, the price tag made me scroll past them, as I had quite a limited budget. In my heart of course I wanted the best possible thing, but I knew it simply wasn&rsquo;t possible so I made a promise to buy it when in the future when I&rsquo;m doing well and continued looking.</p>
<p>Because price was such a big factor, I had to make a very hard decision. Do I go with 4th generation (Haswell) for its cheapness and ubiquity or the latest, 6th generation (Skylake) for future mobility? I initially was set on going for the i5 4690k, a very capable processor (the i7 was out of the question as it&rsquo;d take nearly half my budget alone). However, while looking for CPU&rsquo;s I saw that i5 6600k is actually only $20 more. In my mind, with its slightly better computing, 14 nm process, and general future support, it seemed very logical to but it. So I opted for Skylake in the end.</p>
<p>Even though I had chosen Skylake, it wasn&rsquo;t easy finding other parts to fit it. It would need a motherboard with LGA 1151 socket and it would also need DDR4 memory, both of which were more expensive than the ones compatible with the 4th generation CPU&rsquo;s. However, thanks to sales and careful searching, I was able to find parts that were close to their prices. I got 8 GB of DDR4 2400 MHz Crucial Ballistix RAM for $40. The motherboard was Gigabyte H110M-A for $30 (!!!), PSU was Corsair 650 watt CXM, and the case was a Corsair Spec 02 RED for $50. All in all, I saved a bunch of money!</p>
<p>You may be wondering where all my drives are, along with my GPU. I had three hard drives, so I didn&rsquo;t see a point in buying it, although an SSD would be a huge improvement. I do plan on buying it in the future to increase overall performance and avoid IO capping. As for the GPU, I had a GT 630 in the old desktop, so I scavenged that as well. Because of the budget, I pushed off the GPU for another day.</p>
<p>Now the build was kind kind of frustrating for me, mainly because of the CPU cooler and the motherboard. I bought a Cooler Master Hyper T2 ($20). Installing it was a huge pain in the ass, partly because of its design and partly because of the motherboard. You might have wondered why the motherboard was so cheap, and there is a reason for that. It&rsquo;s a microATX and it has the bare minimal. I should have done more research on the chipsets and gone for the H170 or even the Z170, but this was the cheapest I could find so I went with it. The RAM slots are located right next to the CPU, making installing the cooler as well as RAM a huge difficulty. I struggled with it alone for about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Also I didn&rsquo;t realize the case would come with 3 case fans, and I bought one just in case. Well it turns out I can&rsquo;t use all of them anyways! Why? BECAUSE OF THE MOTHERBOARD. I am currently only able to use one fan in addition to the CPU fan. Pretty sucky. I want to use ALL the fans.</p>
<p>I got my computer to turn on, installed a clean copy of Windows, lost all my pictures in the process (I should have had backups), and I ran Counter Strike. Regrete #2: skimping out on the GPU. I know that Source is a very CPU intensive engine, so I hoped that the GT 630 would be enough to play at a decent framerate, but boy was I ever so wrong. I was previously getting around 70-80 FPS with a dual core Pentium @ 2.8 GHz from like 2008 at 1440 x 900. Having bought a new monitor as well (ASUS 28 in FHD), I of course wanted to try out CS and see my framerates. I was more than disappointed. ~60 FPS at 1920 x 1080. I suspect it&rsquo;s because the GPU is literally unable to keep up with such resolutions and output frames at the same time, so I will be buying a GPU soon. Plus, I&rsquo;d really love to play Fallout on a big screen!</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m pretty satisfied with the build. Although I would definitely switch out the motherboard, hard drive and GPU when I get the chance. And yes, I do plan on over clocking the 6600k so I do need a new motherboard as well as better cooling down the line. Oh also, maybe a mouse? Since I already have a mechanical keyboard a mouse would be a nice addition to it as well. Maybe a Steel Series&hellip;</p>

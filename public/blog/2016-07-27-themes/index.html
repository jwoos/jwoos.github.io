    <p>For as long as I can remember, theming was very important to me. Aesthetics. My idea was that if I were going to use something, it should look nice so that I would enjoy using it. Or I just liked things to look nice&hellip; Whatever may be the case, I think my obsession started with my iPod Touch. At the time, it was an ubiquitous device - the smartphone for that time. It was amazing what I could do with it but for some reason there was no real option to make it look nice. I&rsquo;m not saying it looked ugly but it was lacking that something. Moving around icons wasn&rsquo;t cutting it for me. When I realized that I could theme with my jailbroken iPod, I was elated. I proceeded to change and assess for hours on end - all this for a stupid little device!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, something about the idea wore me out and when I got my Nexus 4 I didn&rsquo;t customize it at all with themes. Instead, I opted for functionality and performance. I flashed many ROMs and kernels trying to get it to be the best it can be. Then came around the phase where I had a sudden desire to change the Chrome theme. I had been using a minimialistic theme and I wanted something a bit more showy. So I searched and searched. It took me many themese and many days before I settled back on my original theme - I barely see the theme anyways. Then I was hit by the phone theme and found myself sinking hours I should have spent sleeping into tweaking it just right. Again, I found myself back on the original. In those cases, my ventures were clearly a waste of time. There was simply nothing to be gained by it. Sure, I&rsquo;d feel a bit better but in the end I ended back up where I started. Net gain of aesthetics is nil while I had a huge loss of time.</p>
<p>The first text editor I picked up one was probably Notepad. I didn&rsquo;t know any better! Thinking back to it, I remember how painful it was and am immensely grateful that it was such a short period of time. Next, I picked up Notepad++ (haha) for its functionality. But something didn&rsquo;t quite sit right with me. It looked just like Notepad execept with more options and tabs, in short - ugly. There is a distinction between minimalistic and ugly albeit a fine one at times. Notepad++ was, to me, quite clearly the latter. This was around the time of GenTech so I decided to give Sublime a try. Everyone else was using it - why not? It was a massive improvement in terms of looks. Functionality wise, I was getting the same deal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I came across plugins one day while browsing Sublime related things. One thing led to another and soon I found myself installing plugins and themes. After a bunch, I settled on Seti. It had a colorscheme I liked and its overall appearance was simply more appealing to me than the vanilla. That&rsquo;s another thing with me, if even a small part doesn&rsquo;t fit I need to look for a new theme which makes the effort a 100x more time intensive. That was great while it lasted&hellip; right? Wrong. As time goes on, I inevitably get exposed to new things: Atom. My first impression of Atom was that it was a reskinned Sublime built with Electron. I still stand by it. Anyways, although the different theme appeased me for a while, it didn&rsquo;t last long. I soon found myself searching for the exact theme I had used in Sublime. If I find a good theme, I&rsquo;ll always keep it in mind since they seem to be so hard to come by. But wait, where is this all going you ask? Bear with me, I&rsquo;m almost done reminiscing about my painful aesthetic urges.</p>
<p>Again, I was introduced to a new text editor: vim. Using it felt awesome but looking at it made me want to cry. It was horrible. So naturally I spent hours searching for a theme but unable to find one I actually liked I half heartedly picked one that looked decent. I even found out that you can theme your shell when I switched over to zsh - the joy! So what? Well these are tools that I use everyday to get work done. I&rsquo;d argue that this is different as it was a tool more than entertainment or whatever else. It was a tool for work, so the effort and time spent on it can be justified. <em>Design is more than aesthetics, it&rsquo;s about functionality as well</em>. I&rsquo;m sure no one wants to use something that looks terrible everyday as a tool, we grow tired of it. Not only does it aggravate our innate desire of beauty it also interferes with work. In fact the current theme I&rsquo;m using in vim is much more intuitive and easier on the eye than what I had first seen when I opened vim. Working with nicer tools just makes me feel better so I don&rsquo;t mind investing in that.</p>
<p>On another note, people want change after periods of consistency. But changing text editors isn&rsquo;t ideal - especially when it&rsquo;s usually at a whim. Customization allows me to put a new theme on an old editor and breathe new life into it. Suddenly I feel as if I had opened it for the first time ever. It&rsquo;s all a time of firsts once again. So yeah, I can&rsquo;t justify the time spent on my phone and devices but on the shell and editor I don&rsquo;t feel as bad about. I mean I still do because it&rsquo;s so hard choosing one that I like. I&rsquo;ve considered designing my own, trust me. However, with the tendency at which I like to switch I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s better for me to just find new ones. Besides, I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you what I want. To wrap that up: I came up with this idea to write about because I just switched my neovim theme (to <code>one</code>) and I am liking it&hellip; so far.</p>

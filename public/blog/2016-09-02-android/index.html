    <p>My first phone was a Motorola Razer, I&rsquo;m sure you have fond memory of those. After that it was the sidekick LX and then a Blackberry. I despised the iPhone and what it stood for: the lack of a physical keyboard. It was just something that I did not think I could do without, so when I was considering a new phone I took a look at the sidekick 4G and went for it. The experience was not a pleasant one to say the least - the OS was meh at best and the phone had random crashes and was slow to respond at times. The touchscreen was terrible and would often act up - but the physical keyboard and the swiveling screen kept me to it. At a certain point I had enough of it and seriously considered buying a new blackberry even if it were out of date. But I realized that I could make the experience a lot less painful by thinking back to my iPod Touch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bought an iPod touch when it was the big thing, right before smart phone sales shot through the roof. Looking back, it was a rather obvious sign of what was to come. After seeing my friend jailbreak it and customize it, I was blown away. Suddenly it wasn&rsquo;t so locked down anymore; I was able to add features and customize it the way I wanted it. It was eye opening to say the least and I was reminded of that while using my sidekick and doing some research. Android by nature was less restricting than iOS after all and after some research I learned about rooting. From there I learned about flashing custom ROMs and flashed several before I settled on one that was not too bad. I&rsquo;d say the rest of my experience with the phone was acceptable except for the occasional moments where the screen would flip out.</p>
<p>After the sidekick was the coveted and highly acclaimed Samsung Galaxy S2. It was <em>the</em> phone at the time although the S3 had just come out - which I was not willing to spend the money for. It was without a doubt, a great phone. However, the TouchWiz was atrocious and I wanted to push the phone to its limits in terms of performance and battery life. I got to rooting and flashing custom ROMs once again. This time around, I must have really pushed it past its limits because I ended up completely bricking it. I was extremely agitated as I had spent good money on buying it and in a matter of a few months I had ended up rendering it no better than a plastic paperweight. It was back to the sidekick&hellip;</p>
<p>The LG Nexus was a beautiful piece of glass and plastic that caught my eye, not only with its looks and specs but with its price tag. It was a top tier midrange phone with an unbeatable price. However, the phone went out of stock almost immediately and I was broke at the time so I let it simmer in the back of mind for a while. After I bricked my S2, I decided to buy a new phone and take good care of it - I bought the Nexus 4 a year after its release. Even then, it was a beautiful phone with decent specs and even better pricing. After the debacle with the S2, it was a long time before I did anything with the Nexus. However, I had to as after a while it began to show its age during daily use. I rooted it and went through a few ROMs as well as some mods. I did soft brick it but to my joy I learned that it was practically impossible to brick the phone as I had the S2 - worst case would be I had to wipe and reflash a ROM. However, after a while ROMs grew old and I loved the simplicity of vanilla Android so I stuck with it and looked for another way to gain performance. I found them in the form of pure mods and custom Kernels. After two long years of usage, it was finally time to switch off and that&rsquo;s where my next phone came in: OnePlus One.</p>
<p>The OnePlus One basically met my desire in a phone: good specs and low price. Plus it shipped with Cyanogen installed, which was a huge plus. I got it a year after its release and overall it wasn&rsquo;t bad but during this time I witnessed the release of the Nexus 5, 6, 5X and 6P. I wanted to go back to the Nexus but they were much more than they used to be and that really deterred me. I&rsquo;m glad that it got to the masses but wasn&rsquo;t so happy that the price had to go up for it to be viable. So I went with the OPO, and I was generally really happy with it. I didn&rsquo;t do anything with ROMs or kernels, but I did install xposed and tweaked certain things that Cyanogen didn&rsquo;t already cover. I loved Adnroid and used to browse XDA all the time but after the Nexus it wore me out a bit so I backed off a lot. I turned from a power user to slightly above the average consumer. This would have continued but I broke the digitizer which brings me to my current phone.</p>
<p>The Nexus 6P. It&rsquo;s one hell of a phone with a unibody aluminum design that just feels high quality in your hands. It&rsquo;s got some heft to it but not enough to make you think it&rsquo;s heavy - just enough to feel solid in your hands. Also probably the last Nexus phone along with the 5X. I was hesitant because I didn&rsquo;t want to shell out for a good phone, but now that it&rsquo;s over and done with, I am very glad I did. It has rekindled my interest in Android and phones; I found myself installing a custom kernel and then searching for a good governor to use with it. My progression with phones has been interesting and seeing where I am now versus a few years ago, even more so. My interest may have fluctuated but there was one constant among that since the Nexus - distaste for Apple and its products. I appreciate the design and the philosophy they embody but I also despise that same thing. They lock down a lot of your things and assume that the average consumer doesn&rsquo;t know anything, which to be fair is absolutely true. However, as a not so average consumer using Apple&rsquo;s devices can sometimes feel claustrophobic almost and the exceedingly high price tag for decent specs - no thanks. Give me my freedom on Android please.</p>

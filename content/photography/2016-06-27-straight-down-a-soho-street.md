This was taken when I was walking around SoHo with my friend and he suddenly said "this would be a nice shot" as we were crossing the street. Looking down the street, I couldn't help but agree. By this point, the signal was about to change so we decided to wait until the next change.

I did get a decent shot out of it, but as someone kindly pointed out, it would have been much better had I been able to center it with the lead line. I've noticed this was a problem whenever I'm taking pictures - I have immense problem centering or even straightening my shots. Something I'll definitely need to work on.

Oftentimes I will regret that I didn't bring my camera somewhere. Times like that, I can use my phone but at times my phone doesn't allow the degree of control afforded by my DSLR. This was one of those times. I was in Tumblr hanging out with my friends when I realized that the light would make a very interesting photo. Luckily, my friend had brought his camera and I was able to snap some pictures but I can't help but feel like I should carry around my camera more often.

The pictures did not come out exactly how I had envisioned - partly because my friend was moving a bit and partly because I was not used to the camera. Regardless, I'm glad that I had something else other than a phone to take pictures with and I will probably try to snap another picture using the light as a background with my own camera.

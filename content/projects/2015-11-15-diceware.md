After reading an article about a little girl making diceware passwords and selling them, I became interested in automating that process. I got into learning about pseudorandom and random numbers, becoming aware that most number generation on a computer is pseudorandom. However, even if it is pseudorandom, there are ways to make them cryotographically secure - which is the method used in this project. Simply put, it will generate 6 random numbers ranging from one to six and look it up in a diceware words table and return that word. This process will repeat for however many words you want. In the end it was a simple but an educational project.

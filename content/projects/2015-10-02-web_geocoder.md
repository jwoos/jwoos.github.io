I was playing around with Google's location API, when I found the geocoding API. I thought it would be fun to create a site to geocode - especially since at the time I needed a geocoding service. I was planning on expanding on it but I never got back to it. However, I did fix the property names so it actually works again!

You can put in an address to get the coordinates for the location. If there are more than one search results that match, it will indicate it and prompt you to search again. You can also go the other way and input coordinates to get the address.
